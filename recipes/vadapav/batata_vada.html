    <h2>Steps to make Batata Vada</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Have all the ingredients ready before starting to make vada. Make a paste of green chilli, ginger and garlic using
        mortar and pestle or in the small chutney jar of a mixer grinder.</li>
        <li>Peel boiled potatoes and mash them with backside of a large spoon.</li>
        <li>Heat 2-teaspoons oil in a small pan over medium flame. Add mustard seeds. When they start to crackle, add asafoetida,
        curry leaves and a paste of green chilli-ginger-garlic.</li>
        <li>Stir and cook for a minute. Add turmeric powder and mix well.</li>
        <li>Turn off the flame and transfer the prepared tempering over mashed potatoes. Add chopped coriander leaves, lemon juice
        and salt.</li>
        <li>Mix well and taste for the lemon juice and salt. If required, add more lemon juice or salt.</li>
        <li>Divide it into 9-10 equal portions. If mixture turns sticky, grease your hands with oil and make round shaped balls from
        it.</li>
        <li>Prepare batter for vada â€“ take gram flour, baking soda and salt in a wide mouthed bowl.</li>
        <li>Add water (approx. 1/3 cup) little by little and stir continuously and make a lump free smooth batter. Consistency of
        the batter should be slightly thinner than dosa batter.</li>
        <li>If batter is too watery then add 1-2 teaspoons gram flour and if it is too thick then add little water and mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium flame for deep-frying. When oil is medium hot, dip each potato ball into batter and coat
        it evenly with hand or spoon and gently drop it into the hot oil. Drop 3-4 balls in a single batch and deep-fry them
        until light golden brown.</li>
        <li>Drain excess oil using perforated spoon and transfer them over paper napkin on a plate. Deep-fry remaining balls.</li>
        <li>Batata Vada is now ready for serving. Serve hot with tea and green chutney / tomato ketch up.</li>
