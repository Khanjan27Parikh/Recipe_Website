        Make sure that steamer is at least 4-5 minutes heated before placing the plates (filled with batter) in it. Grease 2
        small plates or thalis (4-5 inch diameter) using 1-teaspoon oil.</li>
        <li>Take 1 cup gram flour, 1 tablespoon semolina(sooji/rava), 1½ teaspoons lemon juice, 1 teaspoons green chilli-ginger
        paste, 1/4 cup curd, 3/4 cup water and salt in a bowl. Mix them properly into smooth batter. Make sure that there are no
